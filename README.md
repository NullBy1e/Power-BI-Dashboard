# Power-BI-Dashboard

Power BI Project: "Startups with a Mission" – Investment and Growth Analysis (2016–2023)

Project Description:
This project was developed as part of my postgraduate studies in Business Intelligence & Data Analytics at Kozminski University. 
The main objective was to design an interactive, data-driven dashboard that tells a compelling story about the development of startups with positive social and environmental impact. 
The analysis covered 1.666 startups divided into three impact groups (impact, mixed, non-impact), evaluated across global, sectoral and regional dimensions. 
The data used in this project comes from a public Kaggle dataset and is synthetic - it does not reflect actual market data but enables a realistic analysis of trends and relationships within the startup ecosystem. 

Objectives: 
The project aimed to analyze the investment dynamics in socially impactful startups between 2016-2023. To identify regional and sectoral trends in their growth and funding. 

Tools:
Power BI Desktop for data modeling and visualization. Power Query for data cleaning. DAX for calculated measures and KPIs. Slicers, filters, bookmarks, drill-through pages and dynamic titles for interactivity. 

Key Insights:
Sectors with the strongest social and environmental impact, Regions with the highest investment potential, Ranking of startups based on the number of investments received, Capital flow between regions and sectors, Startups growth trends.

Outcomes:
The interactive dashboard was designed for a diverse group of startup stakeholders such as investors (VC, PE and business angels), market analysts, founders, and research institutions. The purpose was to verify the thesis that mission-driven startups are an increasingly significant segment of the market, attracting growing investor interest and developing dynamically worldwide. The analysis aimed to answer key questions about the distribution of investments and activity across industries and regions, identify sectors and regions with the highest growth and efficiency, map the main directions and volumes of investment flows.
